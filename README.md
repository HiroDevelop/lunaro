🌍 Lunaro
Lunaro is an Earth-anchored digital asset designed for transparent experimentation, governance control, and future mainnet deployment.
The project is currently deployed on Ethereum Sepolia (testnet) and focuses on verifiability, controlled distribution, and long-term sustainability rather than speculation.

🔎 Overview
Name: Lunaro
Symbol: LUNARO
Standard: ERC-20 (OpenZeppelin)
Network: Ethereum Sepolia (Testnet)
Status: Public test deployment
Control Model: Ownable + Pausable
Lunaro is intentionally deployed in a controlled environment to allow testing, auditing, and governance validation before any mainnet consideration.

🔐 Governance & Safety
Transfers can be paused/unpaused by the owner
Ownership is assigned to a Reserve / Governance wallet
Designed to support future multisig or DAO transition
No upgradeability hooks are enabled in the current deployment
This ensures predictable behavior during the test phase.

🧪 Purpose of Testnet Deployment
Lunaro on Sepolia is used to:
Validate distribution logic
Test governance controls
Verify pause/unpause mechanics
Observe real-world interaction patterns
Collect developer and community feedback
No economic guarantees are implied.

🚀 Mainnet
There is no mainnet deployment yet.
Mainnet consideration will only occur after:
Code review / audit
Governance model finalization
Clear migration plan
Community and developer validation
